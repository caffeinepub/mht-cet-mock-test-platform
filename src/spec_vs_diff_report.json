  "summary": "The diff shows implementation of admin role verification popups in AdminRegistration.tsx with AlertDialog components, error handling updates in useAdminRegistration.ts, and updated project state tracking. Both REQ-133 (informational popup before registration) and REQ-134 (error popup for unauthorized attempts) appear to be implemented using AlertDialog UI components.",

      "requirement": "The popup should also mention that the first registration is open for initial setup when no admins exist",
      "reason": "The diff shows an info dialog implementation, but the truncated AdminRegistration.tsx content does not reveal whether the popup message differentiates between first admin setup and subsequent registrations. The error dialog message mentions 'After the initial setup' but the info dialog content is not visible in the truncated diff.",
