  "summary": "The implementation covers most backend and frontend requirements for auto-transition logic between test sections. Backend endpoints (getTestAttempt, startSection, submitSection) are implemented with proper validation, timing constraints, and stable storage. Frontend components include test attempt queries, section mutations, countdown timer, transition screen, and submit logic. However, the confirmation dialog implementation (REQ-39) appears incomplete, and some transition details (REQ-41) may need verification. The migration module adds score fields to the data model. Overall, strong alignment with requirements.",

      "reason": "The TestInterface.tsx shows an AlertDialog component structure, but the diff is truncated and does not show the complete implementation or wiring of the dialog trigger. Evidence of the showSubmitDialog state exists, but the actual confirmation flow (trigger, cancel, confirm handlers) is not visible in the truncated code.",
