  "summary": "The implementation provides comprehensive PDF export functionality using browser's print dialog. All core requirements are implemented including library setup (via print dialog instead of jsPDF/react-pdf), utility function creation, PDF layout with branding, score summaries, question breakdowns, statistics, footer with branding, export button, and error handling. The implementation deviates by using browser print dialog rather than a traditional PDF library, which may not satisfy the explicit requirement for jsPDF or react-pdf installation.",

      "reason": "The diff shows pdfExport.ts uses browser's native print dialog (window.print()) rather than installing jsPDF or react-pdf library. No package.json changes are visible to confirm library installation.",
