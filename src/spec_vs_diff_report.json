  "summary": "All four requirements (REQ-107, REQ-108, REQ-109, REQ-110) have been implemented. The Navbar now correctly checks and displays the Admin link for authenticated admin users. The useGetCallerUserRole hook properly fetches and returns user roles from the backend. The backend getUserRole endpoint correctly identifies admin users by checking caller permissions. Comprehensive console logging has been added to the Navbar for debugging. All admin-related pages (AdminDashboard, AdminQuestionCreate, AdminFullSyllabusTestCreate, AdminChapterWiseTestCreate) now use role-based access control with redirection for non-admin users.",
