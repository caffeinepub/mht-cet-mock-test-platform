  "summary": "The diff shows changes to backend logging (main.mo), extensive modifications to AdminRegistration.tsx implementing connection health checks, timeout detection, and phased status indicators, and updates to supporting documentation files. However, critical requirements around useActor.ts hook modifications, identity delegation fixes, and backend canister verification are not evidenced in the diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-197",
      "requirement": "Fix the backend actor initialization timeout in useActor.ts hook that is causing the 22+ second connection delay on AdminRegistration.tsx, ensuring the actor connection completes successfully within a reasonable timeframe (under 5 seconds) or fails with a clear error message",
      "reason": "No modifications to useActor.ts are shown in the diff. The constraint explicitly states 'Do not change the core actor initialization logic in useActor.ts that handles authentication token setup', but REQ-197 requires fixing the timeout in this hook, creating an apparent conflict. The diff shows no changes to useActor.ts at all.",
      "evidence": []
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-198",
      "requirement": "Verify the backend canister at canister ID 7xdrr-pqaaa-aaaae-qgzda-cai is running and responding to queries, investigating any canister stopped or unavailable states that would cause the connection timeout error shown in the AdminRegistration page",
      "reason": "No evidence of canister verification, health checks to the specific canister ID, or investigation of canister state is present in the diff. Backend changes only show enhanced logging in registerAdmin function, not canister state verification.",
      "evidence": []
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-200",
      "requirement": "Add enhanced error logging to the useActor.ts hook actor initialization process that captures and logs the exact failure point causing the connection timeout, including authentication state, identity delegation status, canister reachability checks, and any network errors during the 22+ second connection attempt",
      "reason": "No modifications to useActor.ts are shown in the diff, therefore enhanced error logging in the actor initialization process could not have been implemented.",
      "evidence": []
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-202",
      "requirement": "Fix the Internet Identity authentication delegation that may be causing the extended connection delay, ensuring the identity delegation is valid and not requiring re-authentication during the actor initialization process on the AdminRegistration page",
      "reason": "No evidence of identity delegation validation, expiration checks, or fixes to delegation handling in the diff. AdminRegistration.tsx shows connection phase tracking but no delegation-specific validation logic.",
