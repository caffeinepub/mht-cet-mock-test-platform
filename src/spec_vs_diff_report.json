  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to three files: AdminRegistration.tsx (frontend component), frontend-file-summaries.txt (documentation), and project_state.json (project metadata). The AdminRegistration.tsx changes appear to implement some frontend requirements (REQ-164, REQ-165) with React Query invalidation, success messages, navigation, and principal status checking. However, the diff is truncated and does not show any backend changes to backend/main.mo, which are required for REQ-161, REQ-162, and REQ-163. The backend requirements involving authorization logic fixes, diagnostic logging, and admin principals list initialization are completely missing from the diff.",
